# react-frontend-blog

Welcome to my React Frontend Blog project!

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create reusable UI components.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps us write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
- **React Router**: A standard routing library for React, used for creating single page applications with navigation without the page refreshing as the user navigates.
- **Styled Components**: Utilised for writing CSS in JavaScript, enhancing the styling experience for our React components.
